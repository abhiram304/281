## Objective
Implemented virtualization of mobile sensors and built a multi-tenant, scalable and fault-tolerant cloud application in Node.js. Developed dashboards for users to visualize the sensor data.
Developed the app as a subscription based model where the user can subscribe and unsubscribe to the sensors and get charged for the usage accordingly (pay as you use model).
Deployed the application on various cloud platforms and infrastructures to understand the difference.
Tech: Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js, JQuery, Ajax, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, GoogleMaps API, WebSockets, MySQL, Heroku, AWS, etc.
